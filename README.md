# Using Model-Based Recursive Partitioning to Detect Different Sources of Differential Item Functioning


Research Motivation: When a group difference in a variable that has not been explicitly tested for differential item functioning (DIF), we want to know if a non-pre-specified person covariate would impact the probability of a correct response among equally able examinees for different subgroups.  
Research Hypothesis: A model-based recursive partitioning as a semi-parametric approach can successfully detect non-pre-specified sources of DIF in the parameters of a statistical model between groups of subjects defined by (combinations of) covariates.
